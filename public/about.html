<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, This is Shiny Sherbina. I started my career as a software developer in a reputed MNC. 
  I loved my job. But due to some personal circumstances I decided to quit my job.
</p>

<p>But when the option of remote work opened up, I wanted to come back to IT.
   There were initially lot of scepticism about coming back. 
   But I have decided to put that all aside and take a plunge into web development.
</p>

<p>Right from college, writing codes has been my passion. 
  I have experience in Data warehousing.
  I have good knowledge of SQL, Oracle, PL/SQL, Stored Procedures and Data Stage. 
  But now I want to be a full stack developer. I always love learning different programming languages.
  I strongly believe that it is the logical and analytical thinking that matters the most rather than syntaxes. 
</p>

<p>When I taught my kid "Trust. You can do it" some voice in my head said "Is this for him or for you?".
  So with faith I am taking the plunge. I know that I would do my best in this new endeavour.
